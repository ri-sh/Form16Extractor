# Contributing to Form16 Extractor

Thank you for considering contributing. 

The Form16 Extractor project aims to make working with Indian tax documents easier for developers, and community contributions are what make it better.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug Reports**: Found something broken? Let us know.
- **Feature Requests**: Have an idea for improvement? We would appreciate your feedback.
- **Code Contributions**: Fix bugs, add features, improve performance.
- **Documentation**: Help make our docs clearer and more comprehensive.
- **Testing**: Help test on different Form16 formats and edge cases.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ri-sh/Form16Extractor.git
   cd Form16Extractor
   ```

2. **Set up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install in development mode
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run tests to make sure everything works
   python -m pytest
   
   # Check code formatting
   black --check .
   flake8 .
   ```

## Running Tests

We use pytest for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=form16_extractor

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/          # Model tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/extractors/      # Extractor tests
python -m pytest -m "not slow"              # Skip slow tests

# Run tests for specific Form16 components
python -m pytest tests/unit/extractors/domains/identity/
python -m pytest tests/unit/extractors/domains/salary/
```

## Code Style Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting  
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking

These run automatically via pre-commit hooks, but you can run them manually:

```bash
black .
isort .
flake8 .
mypy form16_extractor/
```

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

Good bug reports help us fix issues faster. Please include:

## Feature Requests Feature Requests

We love new ideas! When suggesting features:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the use case** - what problem does this solve?
3. **Propose a solution** - how should it work?
4. **Consider the scope** - should this be core functionality or a plugin?

### Adding New Extractors

1. **Create in appropriate domain** (`extractors/domains/`)
2. **Implement the interface** (`IExtractor`)
3. **Add comprehensive tests** (`tests/unit/extractors/domains/`)
4. **Update models** if needed (`models/form16_models.py`)

### Testing Guidelines

- **Test real scenarios** but use anonymized data
- **Test edge cases** - missing fields, malformed data
- **Test confidence scoring** - verify extraction quality
- **Mock external dependencies** - PDF libraries, etc.
- **Use descriptive test names** - `test_extract_employee_name_from_key_value_format`

### Privacy & Security

- **No real PII** in tests, examples, or documentation
- **Sanitize error messages** - don't log personal data
- **Local processing only** - no network calls
- **Secure file handling** - proper cleanup of temporary files

## Types of Contributions Types of Contributions We Need

### High Priority
- **Support for new Form16 formats** - different employers use different layouts
- **Better error handling** - more helpful error messages

### Medium Priority  
- **Additional validation** - detect inconsistencies in tax calculations

### Documentation & Testing
- **More examples** - real-world usage patterns
- **Performance benchmarks** - how fast is it?
- **Error scenario docs** - how to handle common issues
- **Integration guides** - using with popular frameworks

## Coding Standards Coding Standards

### Python Style

- **Examples** in docstrings where helpful
- **Type information** in docstrings
- **Error conditions** documented

### Testing
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern
- **Descriptive test names**
- **One assertion per test** (generally)
- **Test both happy path and edge cases**
