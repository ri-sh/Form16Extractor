CURRENT STATUS: UPDATED FOR CLI TOOL REQUIREMENT
Working Directory: /Users/rishabhroy/.claude/local/form16_extractor/
Priority: Build robust CLI tool that works with ANY Form 16 and extracts ALL fields
Next: Implement core PDF processing and extraction modules
============================================

CLI TOOL REQUIREMENTS ADDED:
- Single file processing: python cli.py extract --file form16.pdf --output result.json
- Batch processing: python cli.py batch --input-dir ./pdfs/ --output-dir ./results/
- JSON output with comprehensive field extraction
- Robust handling of any Form 16 document structure
- Validation and error handling
- Performance metrics and logging

UPDATED TASK STATUS:
1.1 Create project directory structure                          [✓]
1.2 Setup Python virtual environment                            [ ]  
1.3 Install core dependencies                                   [ ]
1.4 Create configuration management                             [ ]
2.1 Define Form16 data structures using Pydantic               [✓]
2.2 Create value objects                                        [✓]
2.3 Define business rules and validations                      [✓]
CLI Tool Implementation                                         [✓]
============================================

Key Success Metrics:
- Extraction accuracy: >90% for all major fields
- Processing time: <10 seconds per Form16
- Error handling: Graceful degradation for all failure modes
- Test coverage: >95% for business logic
- Documentation: Complete API and usage documentation

Notes:
- Using Test-Driven Development approach
- Following Clean Architecture principles  
- Implementing SOLID design principles throughout
- Modular design for easy maintenance and extension
- Focus on robustness and error handling from the start
