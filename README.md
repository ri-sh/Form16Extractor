# Form16 Extractor

A production-ready Python library for extracting structured data from Indian Form16 tax documents.

## Overview

Form16 Extractor converts PDF Form16 documents into clean, structured JSON data. Built to handle real-world variations in Form16 formats from different employers and years, it provides reliable extraction of employee information, salary breakdowns, tax deductions, and TDS details.

This library was developed to address the practical challenges of processing Form16 documents at scale - handling inconsistent layouts, mixed table structures, and varying PDF quality while maintaining high accuracy.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: Domain-driven extraction engine with 85-90% field coverage on real Form16 documents
- **Format Flexibility**: Handles variations in layouts across different employers and tax software
- **Privacy Focused**: Local processing only - no data transmission or storage
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and validation
- **Developer Experience**: Full type hints, detailed documentation, and intuitive API

## Form16 Background

Form16 is the official tax certificate issued by employers to employees in India, containing:

- **Part A**: TDS certificate with quarterly tax deduction summary
- **Part B**: Detailed salary computation including basic pay, allowances, exemptions, and deductions under various sections (80C, 80D, etc.)

The challenge with Form16 processing lies in the inconsistent PDF layouts generated by different payroll systems, making reliable data extraction complex.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from form16_extractor.extractors.enhanced_form16_extractor import EnhancedForm16Extractor

# Initialize the extractor
extractor = EnhancedForm16Extractor()

# Extract data from Form16 PDF
result = extractor.extract_from_file("form16.pdf")

# Access structured data
if result.status == "success":
    form16_data = result.data
    
    print(f"Employee: {form16_data.employee_info.employee_name}")
    print(f"Gross Salary: ₹{form16_data.salary_breakdown.gross_salary:,.2f}")
    print(f"PAN: {form16_data.employee_info.employee_pan}")
    
    # Access detailed breakdowns
    deductions = form16_data.deductions
    tds_details = form16_data.quarterly_tds
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Extract single Form16
python cli.py extract --file form16.pdf --output result.json

# Validate extraction results
python cli.py validate --file result.json
```

    if result.status == "success":
        # Process successful extraction
        form16_data = result.data
    elif result.status == "partial":
        # Some data extracted with warnings
        print("Extraction completed with warnings:")
        for warning in result.warnings:
            print(f"- {warning}")
    else:
        # Handle extraction failure
        print(f"Extraction failed: {result.error}")
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Processing error: {e}")
```

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All operations run locally - no external API calls
- **Data Privacy**: No data retention, logging, or transmission
